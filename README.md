## Research Question
How can we use machine learning can prdict diabetes?.


### Abstract

4 sentence longer explanation about your research question. Include:

- opportunity (diabetes data set )
- challenge ( our challenge is to  predict diabetes)
- action (we will solve this problem by using a machine learning model with a pproporiate algorithm "DT Classifier")
- resolution (using "DT Classifier")

### Introduction
Diabetes dataset which is a Ten baseline variables + new veriable"Outcome", age, sex, body mass index, average blood pressure
and six blood serum measurements were obtained for each of n = 442 diabetes patients, as well as the response of interest, a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline, and here we will create a machine learning model based on the dataset we have in order to help us to predict a diabetes.

### Methods
based on the BMI and its levels, i have created a new feature called Outcome and fill it up with approporiate value(0"means the patient doesnt have diabetes" or 1"means the patient has a diabetes" and use it in order to help me predict the diabetes 
Brief Analysis of the diabetes data

### Results

Brief (2 paragraph) description about your results. Include:

- At least 1 figure
- At least 1 "value" that summarizes either your data or the "performance" of your method
- A short explanation of both of the above

### Discussion
Brief (no more than 1-2 paragraph) description about what you did. Include:

- interpretation of whether your method "solved" the problem
- suggested next step that could make it better.

### References
