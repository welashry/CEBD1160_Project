1- Save your dataset "diabetes.csv" to your Desktop 2- To Create a script using Pychram go to your C:\Users\Username\PycharmProjects\Project1 > Create Scripts called  "KNeighborsClassifie.py","Logistic_Regression.py","LogReg_Lasso.py","Models_accuracy.py","Visualize_data.py" and follow the instructions below:- Import the libraries that you will need in your script(pandas-matplotlib-os, and the algorithms  etc..):

3- when you finish your script and want to run it type "python3 Script_name"

RUN pip3 install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly sklearn






COPY diabetes.csv .

COPY KNeighborsClassifie.py .

COPY Logistic_Regression.py .

COPY LogReg_Lasso.py .

COPY Models_accuracy.py .

COPY Visualize_data.py .






CMD ["python3","-u","KNeighborsClassifie.py"]

CMD ["python3","-u","Logistic_Regression.py"]

CMD ["python3","-u","LogReg_Lasso.py"]

CMD ["python3","-u","Models_accuracy.py"]

CMD ["python3","-u","Visualize_data.py"]
```
